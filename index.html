        <h2>What Do We Offer</h2>
        <p class="info">The GCA (Girl Child Advocacy) Inclusion Program is dedicated to empowering orphaned girls who have dropped out of school or never had the chance to attend. Our research in rural communities in northern Ghana confirmed that this issue persists, with many such cases in disadvantaged areas. We are currently supporting four of these girls through apprenticeship programs!</p>
